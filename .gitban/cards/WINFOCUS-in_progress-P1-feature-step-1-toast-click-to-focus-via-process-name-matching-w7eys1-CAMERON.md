## Design & Planning

### Required Reading

| What | Where | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Current win-notify.ps1 | `scripts/win-notify.ps1` (full file, 66 lines) | Understand toast XML, PS 5.1 delegation, AUMID |
| Hook notification dispatch | `install.ps1` lines 1344-1359 | Where parent PID gets passed |
| MediaPlayer event pattern | `scripts/win-play.ps1` lines 15-57 | Model for Register-ObjectEvent + wait loop |
| WSL toast path | `scripts/notify.sh` lines 265-303 | Where `launch` attribute placeholder goes |
| Design doc interface section | `docs/designs/windows-click-to-focus.md` "Interface Design" section | P/Invoke type, Find-FocusableWindow, Set-WindowFocus, activation loop |

### Initial Design Thoughts & Requirements

Per ADR-001, the activation mechanism uses:
- Toast `launch` attribute to carry `parentPid` (wired now, used in Phase 2)
- `ToastNotification.Activated` event handler via `Register-ObjectEvent`
- `SetForegroundWindow` via P/Invoke with `AttachThreadInput` workaround
- Process stays alive for `dismissSeconds + 5s` buffer

Key design decisions (from design doc):
- All focus logic inline in `win-notify.ps1` (WinRT ties Activated event to toast object lifetime)
- P/Invoke over COM `AppActivate` (deterministic window handle targeting vs fragile title matching)
- `AttachThreadInput` over `keybd_event` trick (no input interference)
- Process name priority list: Code > Cursor > Windsurf > WindowsTerminal > powershell > pwsh

### Acceptance Criteria

* [x] `win-notify.ps1` accepts new `-parentPid` parameter (default 0) and includes it in toast `launch="parentPid=$parentPid"` attribute
* [x] P/Invoke type `PeonPing.Win32Focus` loads without error on PS 5.1, containing: `SetForegroundWindow`, `GetForegroundWindow`, `GetWindowThreadProcessId`, `AttachThreadInput`, `GetCurrentThreadId`
* [x] `Find-FocusableWindow` function returns first process with `MainWindowHandle -ne [IntPtr]::Zero` from priority chain (Code, Cursor, Windsurf, WindowsTerminal, powershell, pwsh), or `$null` when none match
* [x] `Set-WindowFocus` function performs `AttachThreadInput` + `SetForegroundWindow` + detach sequence
* [x] Activation event loop: registers `Activated` and `Dismissed` events, polls with 100ms sleep until one fires or timeout (`dismissSeconds + 5s`), calls `Find-FocusableWindow` + `Set-WindowFocus` on activation, cleans up events on exit
* [x] PS 7+ delegation path forwards `-parentPid` parameter to PS 5.1 subprocess
* [x] Hook script in `install.ps1` resolves parent PID via `(Get-Process -Id $PID).Parent.Id` (try/catch -> 0) and passes `-parentPid $parentPid` in notification args
* [x] WSL toast XML in `scripts/notify.sh` includes `launch="parentPid=0"` placeholder attribute
* [x] All new Pester tests pass in `tests/win-click-to-focus.Tests.ps1`
* [x] Existing Pester notification tests still pass (no regression)
* [x] Toast display behavior unchanged (appearance, timing, icon, audio silence)
* [x] Graceful no-op when no matching IDE/terminal process found
* [x] README.md and README_zh.md updated: Desktop Notifications section mentions click-to-focus on Windows

## Feature Work Phases

| Phase / Task | Status / Link to Artifact or Card | Universal Check |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **P/Invoke Type + Focus Functions** | Add `Win32Focus` type, `Find-FocusableWindow`, `Set-WindowFocus` to `win-notify.ps1` | - [x] Design Complete |
| **Toast Activation Loop** | Add `-parentPid` param, `launch` attr, `Activated`/`Dismissed` event loop | - [x] Test Plan Approved |
| **Hook Script Integration** | Resolve parent PID in `install.ps1` hook, pass to win-notify | - [x] Implementation Complete |
| **WSL Placeholder** | Add `launch="parentPid=0"` to `notify.sh` WSL toast XML | - [x] Integration Tests Pass |
| **Pester Tests** | New `tests/win-click-to-focus.Tests.ps1` | - [x] Documentation Complete |
| **README Updates** | Desktop Notifications section in README.md + README_zh.md | - [ ] Code Review Approved |

## TDD Implementation Workflow

| Step | Status/Details | Universal Check |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **1. Write Failing Tests** | Pester tests: parameter acceptance, toast XML structure, process discovery, focus sequence, graceful no-op, PS 7+ delegation | - [x] Failing tests are committed and documented |
| **2. Implement Feature Code** | `win-notify.ps1`: P/Invoke type, functions, event loop. `install.ps1`: parent PID. `notify.sh`: launch attr | - [x] Feature implementation is complete |
| **3. Run Passing Tests** | All new Pester tests pass | - [x] Originally failing tests now pass |
| **4. Refactor** | Clean up, ensure consistent error handling | - [x] Code is refactored for clarity and maintainability |
| **5. Full Regression Suite** | Run full Pester suite: `Invoke-Pester -Path tests/` | - [x] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e) |
| **6. Performance Testing** | Verify no noticeable latency on toast display; confirm process exits after timeout | - [x] Performance requirements are met |

### Implementation Notes

**Test Strategy:**

Unit tests (Pester) with mocked `Get-Process` and mocked P/Invoke type:
- `Find-FocusableWindow` returns correct process in priority order
- `Find-FocusableWindow` returns `$null` when no process matches
- `Find-FocusableWindow` skips processes with `MainWindowHandle = [IntPtr]::Zero`
- `Set-WindowFocus` calls AttachThreadInput before SetForegroundWindow, detaches after
- Toast XML string contains `launch="parentPid=..."` attribute
- `win-notify.ps1` accepts `-parentPid` parameter
- Hook script in `install.ps1` passes `-parentPid` in notification args

Structural tests:
- PS 7+ delegation forwards all new parameters
- `notify.sh` WSL toast XML includes `launch` attribute

**Key Implementation Decisions:**

1. All logic in `win-notify.ps1` — WinRT ties `Activated` event to `ToastNotification` object lifetime
2. P/Invoke via `Add-Type -MemberDefinition` (first usage in codebase, establishes precedent)
3. Wait loop modeled on `win-play.ps1` MediaPlayer pattern (proven approach)
4. Process name list includes "Code - Insiders" variant for VS Code Insiders

## Validation & Closeout

| Task | Detail/Link |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Code Review** | PR review |
| **QA Verification** | Manual test: single VS Code window focused on toast click |
| **Regression** | Full Pester suite passes |

### Follow-up & Lessons Learned

| Topic | Status / Action Required |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Further Investigation?** | Verify actual process names for Cursor, Windsurf, Zed on Windows during implementation |
| **Technical Debt Created?** | None expected |
| **Future Enhancements** | Phase 2 (PID-based exact targeting) — separate card |
